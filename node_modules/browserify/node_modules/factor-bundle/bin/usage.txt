usage: factor-bundle [ x.js -o bundle/x.js ... ] > bundle/common.js

Read `module-deps` json output from stdin, factoring each entry file out into
the corresponding output file (-o).

If there is a trailing unpaired `-o`, that file will be used for the common
bundle output. Otherwise, the final bundle is written to stdout.
